              1. What is a stock? Bond? ETF? Portfolio?
              Stock: a type of investment which signifies your ownership of a company.
              Bond: a type of investment where you lend money to the government for a defined amount of time at a fixed interest rate. Typically has lower return than stocks, but are generally considered safer.
              ETF: stands for "exchange-traded fund". It is a type of fund which tracks an index (a measure of performance of the market), a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets, rather than a single stock or bond. It trades like stocks and you own the shares of the underlying assets.
              Portfolio: a portfolio is a grouping of assets -- stocks, bonds, and/or ETF's.
              
              2. What is meant by "current assets"?
              By "current assets" in the risk profile questionnaire, it is asking for your monthly income -- salary if applicable plus other income sources.
              
              3. What is meant by "current liabilities"?
              By "current liabilities" in the risk profiles questionnaire, it is asking for your expenses that are due immeidiately within a month.
              
              4. Why am I investing in multiple assets?
              Investing in multiple assets is a practice of diversification to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. By diversifying your portfolio with assets of different classes, from differnet industries, with varying maturities, etc., you can minimize the risk associated with your portfolio.
              
              5. What is the risk in investing?
              Risk is understood as the possibility that your portfolio may lose value over time. Diversification is a means by which this risk is minimized.
              
              6. How do I know how well my portfolio performs?
              Performance of your portfolio is most simply measured by its rate of return. Rate of return is the growth of your portfolio overtime. On Finewbie, there are two different types of rates of returns:
              Holding period rate of return (HPRR): rate of return on portfolio over a single time period.
              Time weighted rate of return (TWRR): rate of return on portfolio since the very beginning until now.
              
              7. Why do I need a financial advisor?
              There is an enormous array of financial options available and selecting the one that will best meet your needs is vital part to your long-term investment success. A financial advisor will help identify your risk profile, your financial goals and your overall financial position. With this knowledge the advisor can help you select a combination of investments tailored to match your needs now and in the future. Financial advisors’ experience and skills bring clarity and focus to a subject that can often seem complex and daunting.

              8. I have kept my savings in a bank account for many years. Why should I now switch to investment funds?
              Although bank accounts are generally considered very safe investments, interest rates in most countries are at their lowest level in many decades and bank savings provide very low returns. Investment funds offer investors the opportunity to earn higher returns, either to increase income or to save for future needs. The vast choice of funds available allows you to select investments that suit your willingness to take risks – or not.

              9. Am I too old to plan for my retirement?
              Obviously the younger you start to invest for your retirement the better, but anyone – even a person just five years away from retiring – can still take steps to increase the amount of money available upon retirement. However, older investors should adopt a more cautious investment strategy to minimise the risk of a significant loss of capital in the run-up to their retirement. Younger investors, on the other hand, can be more aggressive, as they have many years of earning and investing ahead in which to make up any short-term losses.

              10. Why should I invest in investment funds rather than directly in stocks and bonds?
              Investment funds provide a cost-effective and efficient way to access a wide variety of financial assets. With a portfolio of assets selected to meet specific investment objectives, investment funds are available to suit every type of investor, from the most cautious to the most adventurous. Investment decisions for a fund are taken by trained professionals with years of specialist experience. Direct investment in shares and bonds, on the other hand, requires in-depth knowledge both of companies and of the economic environment. Even with help from a financial advisor, it is a time-consuming and expensive process that should only be attempted by sophisticated and experienced investors with time to devote to making financial decisions and acting on them.
